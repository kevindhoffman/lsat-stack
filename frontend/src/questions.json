      "A": "The reasoning is valid and properly applied.",
      "B": "The argument confuses sufficiency with necessity.",

    "professor_feedback": {
      "veritas": {
        "correct": "You spotted the clean deductive structure. Classic logic.",

      "oak": {
        "correct": "Solid grasp on foundational contract logic. Well done.",
        "incorrect": "Remember: no consideration, no contract. It's basic but essential."
